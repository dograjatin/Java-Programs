//Print all primes less than or equal to n
//    Description
//    You will be given an integer n. You need to print all the prime numbers that are less than or equal to n in the ascending order.
//
//    Input: The input will be in the following format:
//    The first line should be the value of n.
//
//
//    Output: The output should be in the following format
//    In the first line, print all the prime numbers that are less than or equal to n in the ascending order and separate them by spaces.
//
//    Note: If there is no prime number less than or equal to n, then print â€˜There are no prime numbers less than or equal to n'
